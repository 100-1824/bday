Our conversation flowed so smooth that I didn't even notice and you became a part of my daily routine, waiting for you to text or send me a reel so that I could drag that into a conversation felt amazinggg!!! It did make me feel restless back once (cause sometimes waiting wasn't easy) but then dheere dheere things worked out between us and on 10th of October we confessed 🤧 or let's say I made you do that 👀 since that very day my feelings for you have just grown stronger 🤧\n\nI know that us being an endgame seems like a dream but we don't really know what our future holds so for time being I'd just give you all the love I can! And who knows, together, with prayer, faith and patience we could make it! \n\nWell well let's not get emotional here 👀 I've  prepared something for you, it might not be the bestest gift one could receive but given the distance and halaat of our mulks this was the most I could do for you on this special day 🥺 Hope it'll make your day a little better 🤧\n\nHere are 22 letters, #Letters 💌  that I've written for you, (as you've turned 22) each other based on different emotions/situations! \n\nAlso, you often keep asking me, \"Why me? kya hai aisa hm me\" \"Kyu krti hai hmse itna pyaar?\" and more such questions, so I'll be telling you 22 such reasons why I love you. There are a lot more reasons, which I won't even be able to pen down but I've managed to put 22 of them into words, so that you know how special you're to me! \nFind these in #Reasons ❤️\u200d🩹 \n\nI've also attached the poems that I'd written for you earlier. #Poems 🖇️ \n\nYou can go to the labels and find them! \nHope you'd like it! 😭\nHappy birthday once again and I love you! 🥺🩷\n\n","title":"Happy birthday Umzyy 🩷","userEditedTimestampUsec":1748499102300000,"createdTimestampUsec":1746793816839000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Happy birthday love, I don't know where to start, there's lot of emotions and I won't be able to express them all but I'd try to put them into words as much as I can!<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">So the day we started talking I never thought you'd mean so much to me, that I'd find myself waiting with such excitement for your birthday! 👀<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">At first the only reason I added you was because your name was 'Umair' and I wanted to have an Umair in my followers list, I never thought we'd even talk like that!
