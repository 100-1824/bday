Sometimes life gives us something so rare and beautiful that it almost feels unreal (especially after we've had gone through a lot in the past.) That\u2019s what you are to me. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nI know things haven\u2019t been perfect. We\u2019ve had moments of doubt, anger, anxiety, overthinking, and tears. But despite that, one thing remains clear in my heart that I love you. And I\u2019m not giving up on us. \n\nRelationships aren\u2019t easy, especially for me that too when distance, differences, and fears come in the way. But I believe that if two people are willing to try, like really try, then love can still win. And I am willing. I want us to keep choosing each other, even on the days it feels hard. \ud83e\udd7a \n\nLet this be a reminder for both of us, We\u2019re not alone in this. We\u2019ve got each other, and more importantly, we\u2019ve got God walking with us through every challenge and every beautiful moment. So let\u2019s be patient. Let\u2019s be honest. Let\u2019s heal where it hurts and grow stronger together. \n\nWe may not have all the answers now, but we have a chance, and that\u2019s something worth holding on to.\ud83e\ude77\n\n\nHere's a Prayer for Us \ud83e\udd27\n\nHeavenly Father,\nWe come before You with open hearts, asking You to bless our relationship. Be the center of our love, the healer of our wounds, and the guide for our future. Strengthen the bond we share and help us trust each other the way You call us to. Teach us to love with grace, to forgive quickly, and to communicate with gentleness and truth.\nIf this relationship is Your will, Lord, then help us protect it, nurture it, and grow within it. And if we ever lose our way, please show us the path that leads back to You and to each other.\nIn Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.\n\n\n",

Whatever it is, I want you to know that it\u2019s okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. It doesn\u2019t make you weak.

You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s enough. One step at a time is still progress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like it.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s your health , I\u2019m really hoping you\u2019re taking care of yourself.
